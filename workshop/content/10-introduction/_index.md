In the **first part**, you will spend some time setting up a development environment and learn about 
different CloudFormation components and features by setting up simple EC2 Web Server. 

In the **second part** of the workshop, the concept of _Nested Stacks_ will be introduced, along with a guide to 
demonstrate putting individual templates together. You will also learn how to package and deploy a _Nested Stack_ 
from an S3 bucket along with the basic CloudFormation lifecycle: `Deploy -> Update -> Delete`.

**Finally**, we will share some _tips and tools_ when building CloudFormation templates.
