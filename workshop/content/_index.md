# Welcome Builders!

Welcome to the AWS CloudFormation Workshop!

The intent of this workshop is to educate builders about the features of AWS CloudFormation and how to get started building quickly.

Background in CloudFormation, command line, git, and development workflow is not required, we will give you helping hand.

So what we are going to build? 

We will spend some time setting up development environment and learning a little about 
different CloudFormation components.

Then, we will introduce concept of nested stacks and how to start putting individual templates together.

Finally, we will show how to deploy the stack with a simple bash script.

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

* Set up simple development environment
* Understand different CloudFormation components and its use
* Create nested stack
* Package and Deploy the CloudFormation templates
