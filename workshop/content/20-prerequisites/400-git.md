## Install Git on Mac OS X

There are several ways to install Git on a Mac. In fact, if you've installed XCode (or it's Command Line Tools), 
Git may already be installed. To find out, open a terminal and enter `git --version`.

```bash
git --version
git version 2.7.0 (Apple Git-66)
```

### Install Git with Homebrew

If you have [installed Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to manage packages on OS X, you can follow these instructions to install Git:

1. Open your terminal and install Git using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install git
```

1. Verify the installation was successful by typing which `git --version`

### Git for Mac Installer

If you don't have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), you can install Git on a Mac via stand-alone installer:

1. Download the latest [Git for Mac installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/).
1. Follow the prompts to install Git.
1. Open a terminal and verify the installation was successful by typing `git --version`

## Install Git on Windows

### Git for Windows stand-alone installer

1. Download the latest [Git for Windows installer](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).
1. When you've successfully started the installer, you should see the Git Setup wizard screen. Follow the Next and Finish
 prompts to complete the installation. The default options are pretty sensible for most users.
1. Open a Command Prompt (or Git Bash if during installation you elected not to use Git from the Windows Command Prompt).
1. Run the following commands `git --version`

```bash
git --version
git version 2.23.0.windows.1
```
