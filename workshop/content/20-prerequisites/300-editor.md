You may use any code editor or IDE of your choice that supports editing [YAML](https://yaml.org/) but for this workshop we will assume the use of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as it works well on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

To install VS Code, use your operating system's package manager (e.g. `brew cask install visual-studio-code` on macOS) or follow [the instructions on the VS code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
