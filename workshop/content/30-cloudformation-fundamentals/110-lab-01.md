Lets deploy our first stack. In this Lab, you will write simple template which will deploy S3 bucket. 

The bucket will be used later on when we introduce _Nested Stacks_.

{{% notice note %}} 
YAML format will be used to reduce the length of code and increase readability, compared to JSON. 
{{% /notice %}}
