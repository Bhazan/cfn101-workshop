In this section, you will be introduced to the basic concepts of CloudFormation.

+ AWS CloudFormation allows you to model your entire infrastructure in a text file. 
You can use JSON or YAML to describe what AWS resources you want to create and configure. 

+ AWS CloudFormation automates the provisioning and updating of your infrastructure in a safe and controlled manner. 
There are no manual steps or controls that can lead to errors. 

+ AWS CloudFormation is available at no additional charge. You pay only for the AWS resources needed to run your applications.
