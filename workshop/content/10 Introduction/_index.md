# Introduction

So what we are going to build? 

In the **first part**, we will spend some time setting up development environment and learning about 
different`CloudFormation components and features`. In this part we will set up simple EC2 Web Server. 

In the **second part** of the workshop, we will introduce concept of `Nested Stacks` and how to start putting individual templates together.
How to package and deploy nested Stack from S3 bucket and the whole CloudFormation lifecycle `Deploy -> Update -> Delete`.
